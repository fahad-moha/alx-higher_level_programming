**How to Connect to a MySQL Database from a Python Script:**

To connect to a MySQL database from a Python script, you can use the `mysql-connector-python` library. First, make sure you have the library installed by running `pip install mysql-connector-python` in your command line.

Here's an example of connecting to a MySQL database:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="your_username",
  password="your_password",
  database="your_database"
)

# Perform database operations...

# Close the connection
cnx.close()
```

Replace `"localhost"`, `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_database"` with the appropriate values for your MySQL server.

**How to SELECT Rows in a MySQL Table from a Python Script:**

Once you have established a connection, you can execute SQL queries to retrieve data from a MySQL table using the `cursor` object.

Here's an example of selecting rows from a table:

```python
import mysql.connector

cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="your_username",
  password="your_password",
  database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute a SELECT query
query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all rows
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Process the results
for row in rows:
  print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Replace `"your_table"` with the name of the table you want to select rows from.

**How to INSERT Rows in a MySQL Table from a Python Script:**

To insert rows into a MySQL table, you can execute an `INSERT` query using the `cursor` object.

Here's an example of inserting a row into a table:

```python
import mysql.connector

cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="your_username",
  password="your_password",
  database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute an INSERT query
query = "INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)"
values = ("value1", "value2")
cursor.execute(query, values)

# Commit the changes
cnx.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Replace `"your_table"` with the name of the table you want to insert rows into. Modify the query and values to match your table structure and the values you want to insert.

**What ORM Means:**

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented paradigms. Instead of writing SQL queries directly, an ORM provides an abstraction layer that maps database tables to classes and database rows to objects. This enables developers to perform database operations using familiar object-oriented syntax.

ORMs simplify database operations by handling tasks such as object creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, as well as mapping between objects and database tables. They also provide features like query building, data validation, and relationship management.

Popular ORM libraries for Python include SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee.

**How to Map a Python Class to a MySQL Table:**

To map a Python class to a MySQL table, you can use an ORM library like SQLAlchemy. Here's a simplified example using SQLAlchemy's declarative syntax:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class YourTable(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'your_table'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50))
    age = Column(Integer)
```

In this example, `YourTable` is a Python class that represents a table in the database. Each attribute of the class corresponds to a column in the table. By defining the table structure in this way, you can use the ORM to perform database operations, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Please note that this is just a basic example, and there are more advanced features and configurations available in SQLAlchemy and other ORM libraries.

**How to Create a Python Virtual Environment:**

A Python virtual environment allows you to create an isolated environment with its own Python installation and packages. This is useful when you want to work on different projects with different dependencies without conflicts.

Here's how you can create a virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module in Python:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

3. Run the following command to create the virtual environment:

   ````
   python -m venv env_name
   ```

   Replace `env_name` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

    ```
     env_name\Scripts\activate
   ````

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source env_name/bin/activate
     ```

5. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages and run Python scripts without interfering with your system-wide Python installation.

6. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the following command:

   ```
   deactivate
   ````

Remember to replace `env_name` with the actual name you chose for your virtual environment.
